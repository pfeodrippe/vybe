## TODO

- [x] fix memory leak
- [x] solve lexical scope for with-each
- [x] fix already closed issue
- [x] solve lexical scope for with-system
- [x] call sclang
  - so we can use pseudo ugens easily and create synthdefs from it
  - it's meant to be used only in dev time
  - [x] compile synthdef
    - [x] transpile from clj into SC
    - [x] save
  - [x] plot
  - [x] read byte stream
  - [x] help (.help)
- [x] caching for sclang synthdefs so we can use it transparently
- [x] make `sclang-path` more flexible
- [ ] general cpp plugin that allow us to dynamically change a ugen
  - [-] maybe using jank?
    - no as it's changing its internals
  - [ ] can we start a REPL from a JVM started from C++?

    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/819536/how-to-call-java-functions-from-c
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7715804/how-to-use-find-jni-on-cmake/7716814#7716814
    - [x] call a static java method
    - [ ] call clj
      - [x] set classpath
      - [x] call function
      - [ ] call once per next (kr)
      - [ ] start REPL
  - [ ] janet
    - https://github.com/janet-lang/janet
    - [x] call janet from plugin
    - [x] eval janet code
    - [x] compile c code
    - [ ] hot reload only at constructor
      - https://jameshfisher.com/2017/08/24/dlopen/
      - [x] check that it works
      - [ ] use for setting freq
    - [ ] hot reload for every shared lib modification
- [ ] clerk viewer for overtone synths
  - [ ] how to get info about existing synthdefs?
    - [ ] parse schelp for additional operators
      - https://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Guides/WritingHelp.html
      - [ ] parse metadata
      - [ ] parse function
        - [ ] arguments
        - [ ] description
  - [ ] show in clerk
  - [ ] create synthdef out of it
  - [ ] show nodes
    - we have `synthdef-decompile` in overtone, can use it as the base
    - [ ] binary op, how to show the used op?
    - [ ] loaded synthdefs
  - [ ] show args
  - [ ] play example
  - [ ] show the ugens in multiple steps so the user can play the step they need
  - [ ] you can hear, viz plots and call other ops on them (e.g. FFT)
  - [ ] choose input (sawtooth, sine, any)

- [x] deploy to clojars
  - [x] vybe
- [x] compile libs to targets
  - [x] windows
  - [x] linux
  - [x] osx
    - [x] universal?
- [ ] Use https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer?
- [ ] debug arena by tracing calls (for memory leak)
- [ ] ability to apply locks when creating an VybeFlecsSetEntity
