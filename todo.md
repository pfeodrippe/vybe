  - [ ] `defdsp` could watch the used vars so it can compile itself automatically (only `:the-var`)
  - [ ] a `defn*` coukd test itself and check that it has the same results as
        the clojure one?
  - [ ] ability to load vars dynamically (using dlopen) so it speeds up compilation
        (and enables hot reloading (using some trickery))?
