## TODO

- [x] fix memory leak
- [x] solve lexical scope for with-each
- [x] fix already closed issue
- [x] solve lexical scope for with-system
- [x] call sclang
  - so we can use pseudo ugens easily and create synthdefs from it
  - it's meant to be used only in dev time
  - [x] compile synthdef
    - [x] transpile from clj into SC
    - [x] save
  - [x] plot
  - [x] read byte stream
  - [x] help (.help)
- [ ] clerk viewer for overtone synths
  - [ ] how to get info about existing synthdefs?
    - [ ] parse schelp for additional operators
      - https://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Guides/WritingHelp.html
      - [ ] parse metadata
      - [ ] parse function
        - [ ] arguments
        - [ ] description
  - [ ] show in clerk
  - [ ] create synthdef out of it
  - [ ] show nodes
    - we have `synthdef-decompile` in overtone, can use it as the base
    - [ ] binary op, how to show the used op?
    - [ ] loaded synthdefs
  - [ ] show args
  - [ ] play example
  - [ ] show the ugens in multiple steps so the user can play the step they need
  - [ ] you can hear, viz plots and call other ops on them (e.g. FFT)
  - [ ] choose input (sawtooth, sine, any)

- [x] deploy to clojars
  - [x] vybe
- [x] compile libs to targets
  - [x] windows
  - [x] linux
  - [x] osx
    - [x] universal?
- [ ] Use https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer?
- [ ] debug arena by tracing calls (for memory leak)
- [ ] ability to apply locks when creating an VybeFlecsSetEntity
- [ ] general cpp plugin that allow us to dynamically change a ugen
  - [ ] maybe using jank?
